# Hearthstone-Visualization-Project
This project was created by Kyle Dennison for a Data Visualization final class project. Using a dataset of cards from the popular online card game Hearthstone, this Shiny app presents four visualizations of interesting information for each playable class in the game. 




To run this project download and open the HearthstoneVisualization.Rproj inside of Rstudio. Inside the project open the app.R file and click the Run App button. Inside of the application the drop down menu can be used to select different classes from the game. 
The Hearthstone Visualization Design Paper explains the inspiration for the project, its intended audience, and why each visualization was chosen. It also explains the characteristics of the cards in the cards.csv file from http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/, and how they work in the context of games in Hearthstone.
